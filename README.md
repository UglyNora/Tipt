*Hey ShiptShopper, remember that last order with the extremely finicky customer who took over fifteen minutes of your precious time to decide which hand soap to buy? Yes! That same customer who lived on the fourth floor, ordered tons of bulky, hard to carry items, made you late for the next order, didn't bother with a tip, gave you a low rating for no reason, and never even said: "Thank you"!
